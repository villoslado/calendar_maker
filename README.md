# Calendar Generator ðŸ“…

This Python program generates a text-based calendar for any month of a given year. The calendar is formatted with clear, easy-to-read columns and rows representing each day of the week. Additionally, the generated calendar is saved as a `.txt` file to your local `Downloads` folder.

## Features

- Generates a calendar for any month and year.
- Displays the days of the week (Sunday to Saturday).
- Automatically adjusts the starting day and aligns the calendar properly.
- Saves the generated calendar to your `Downloads` folder as a `.txt` file.

## How It Works

The program will prompt you for the following:

1. **Year**: Youâ€™ll be asked to enter a year (e.g., 2024).
2. **Month**: Next, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a month number (e.g., 1 for January, 12 for December).

Once the inputs are provided, the program will generate a neatly formatted calendar for the given month and year and display it on the screen. The calendar is also saved as a `.txt` file, named according to the year and month.

## Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the Python script in your terminal:

```bash
python calendar_generator.py
